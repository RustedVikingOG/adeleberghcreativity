      <p>
        Ad√©le Bergh has a passion for people, photography and art. She believes that everyone has the
        ability to be an artist in a specific form and only needs guidance to unleash their unique creative
        talents.
      </p>
      <p>
        With qualifications in Social Work and Psychology as well as Natural Science, she started her career
        as a social worker within the South African Police Service in 1987, but a few years later she decided
        to follow her dreams and started a Private Practice in social work and an Art Framing Business
        simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004 she registered Adele Bergh Creativity Centre where she focused on whole brain
        development for children from the surrounding areas. With her academic background and
        experience in working with individuals and groups, she developed and compiled a creativity
        curriculum consisting of 110 progressively developing lessons and broadened her lessons to
        accommodate all ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Creativity Centre allows for individuals within the group to develop their artistic ability at their
        own pace and interest, resulting in her attending to a group session where all the students are
        focused on different lessons within the curriculum. During this interaction she uses art as a language
        in the holistic creative development process of the students.
      </p>
      <p>
        She further exposed all students to exhibitions (online or where possible at selected venues). The
        Creativity Centre was also actively involved in community outreach projects such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Sisonke Educare (SARFAT community projects) where they collected and sponsored stationery and art equipment to the children in need.</li>
        <li>Tyger Bear Project at Tygerberg Hospital, where the students sponsored their own works of art in order to uplift the children's therapy rooms.</li>
        <li>Collection and sponsoring of stationery and art equipment to schools in the developing areas such as Lawrencia Primary School.</li>
        <li>The Winter Hope Project in the Western Cape Province where they collected and sponsored clothes and blankets for those in need.</li>
        <li>Yearly contributions to the Association of Mouth and Foot Painters of South Africa</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Today she is a self-taught artist and resides in Brackenfell, Cape Town. She is also an experienced
        teacher, facilitator and photographer. She started painting birds and their environment they live in
        everyday and that led her to painting flowers and pollinators. She loves watercolours, as well as
        graphite and ink pen drawings. Where possible she does quick onsite drawings and takes
        photographs to then at a later stage fill in the details in her studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an artist she appreciates the colours, shapes and patterns in nature, but as a conservationist she
        understands the sensitive balance within the ecosystem. This gives her a better understanding of her
        subject and therefor motivates her to be a better artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        She is also a registered member of the South African Society of Artists (SASA), Stellenbosch Arts
        Association , Botanical Artists Association of South Africa (BAASA) and Constantiaberg Art Society
        (CAS), and participated in numerous group exhibitions. She has been nominated numerous times to
        take part in The Annual-Exhibition of SASA, where participants are identified during a selection
        period by independent judges. These exhibitions are held at Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. During
        the 2024 selection weekend one of her works was highly commended by the judges.
